      "On September 4th – 5th, 2025, Philipp and Matthias have visited our team with a presentation that aimed to appreciate and ignite us with the mindset of building a #promisechain. In contrast to the old supply chain of storing goods and selling them to customer, this #promisechain is a circular loop that include planned promises being translated into full deliveries, going full circle back to the customer. Being a customer-forward model, many achievements have been made, across customer satisfaction, inventory, stock availability, and forecast accuracy."

      "On the July 18th, 2025, we had our 4th Digi-awareness session, learning about the different tips & tricks of SAP. Starting from the logon and home screen, we can add our favorite system / t-codes to top section, create folders to help us with navigation, change languages, and save these settings as a file for later uploads. Then, navigating from our home screen to each t-codes, some shortcuts can be used to open new ones / new windows, and close the current one even while running. Inside our t-codes, further personalization can be carried out with creating & saving variants, creating & saving layouts, and filtering & sorting tables before downloading as an excel file."
