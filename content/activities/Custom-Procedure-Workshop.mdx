## Understanding HS Codes

Starting with the HS Code, we must remember its format of 6 international standard codes with 2-4 country-specific numbers. Then, determining the specific code with the 6 GRIs (general rules of interpretation), we must rely on GRI 5 for all packaging – except for transportation.

## Customs Value Declaration

With the code now defined, declaring its customs value depends on our transaction values plus all payables before destination port, minus all costs beyond this point. However, as transaction values can be manipulated, 5 other methods are used in its stead, depending on certain situations.

## Tax Calculations

Finally, with our HS code and Customs value now ready to be written into the declaration form, we then go to the steps of calculating taxes, applying 4 main types:

- **Tariffs**
- **VAT**
- **SCT**
- **EPT**

### Reducing Tariffs

Fortunately, specifically for tariffs, this tax is reducible with MFN and FTA – through the utilization of C/O (country of origin). To decide whether our shipment is eligible, however, we must rely on these 4 rules:

1. Wholly obtained
2. Change in tariff classification
3. Regional value content
4. Specific process rule
