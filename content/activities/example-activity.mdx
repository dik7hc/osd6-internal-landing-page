## Four Image Grid

Four images display in a complete 4-column grid, creating a gallery-like experience:

![Workshop](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522071820081-009f0129c71c?w=800&h=600&fit=crop "Workshop")

This is the maximum grid size and works wonderfully for comprehensive event coverage.

## Five Images (Displays First Four)

When you add five images, the system intelligently displays only the first four in a grid:

![Team building](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1557804506-669a67965ba0?w=800&h=600&fit=crop "Team Building")
![Innovation hub](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1600880292203-757bb62b4baf?w=800&h=600&fit=crop "Innovation Hub")
![Creative space](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573497019940-1c28c88b4f3e?w=800&h=600&fit=crop "Creative Space")

The fifth image is automatically excluded to maintain the clean 4-column layout.

## Six Images (Also Displays First Four)

Similarly, six images will show only the first four:
