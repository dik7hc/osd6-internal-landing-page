On July 18th, 2025, we had our 4th Digi-awareness session, learning about the different tips & tricks of SAP.

## SAP Customization Tips

Starting from the logon and home screen, we can add our favorite system / t-codes to top section, create folders to help us with navigation, change languages, and save these settings as a file for later uploads.

## Navigation Shortcuts

Then, navigating from our home screen to each t-codes, some shortcuts can be used to open new ones / new windows, and close the current one even while running.

Inside our t-codes, further personalization can be carried out with creating & saving variants, creating & saving layouts, and filtering & sorting tables before downloading as an excel file.

## Looking Forward

As this session brings us a step closer to the last UXcellent session of the year, we hope that everyone will continue to keep up this professional positive energy, and finish the year strong with a new level in UX maturity.
