## The Promise Chain Concept

In contrast to the old supply chain of storing goods and selling them to customer, this #promisechain is a circular loop that include planned promises being translated into full deliveries, going full circle back to the customer.

Being a customer-forward model, many achievements have been made, across customer satisfaction, inventory, stock availability, and forecast accuracy.

## Future Direction

Looking into the future, Matthias has mentioned the upcoming pivot from internal improvements, to strengthening external relations.
